This repository is a minimal scaffold for the BokTalent project.

What is included:

- TailwindCSS + PostCSS
- ESLint + Prettier (config placeholders)
- Vitest for unit tests
- Playwright for e2e tests
- Basic role routes: /player, /scout, /school, /admin
- `.env.example` with required keys
- GitHub Actions workflow placeholder

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd /path/to/boktalent
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```
